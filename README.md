==============================

A simple command line interface for http://multiplayerrobot.com/

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

I am still developing this so it may not easily work for you.

Development Notes and Ideas
---------------------------

*./gmrh games*

Lists all games you're currently in, with player names.

*./gmrh load*

Show a list of games where it's your turn, then when selecting one, it will download the save file to the default location in Linux.

*./gmrh submit* (Not implemented yet)
