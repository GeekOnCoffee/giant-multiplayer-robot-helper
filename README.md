A simple command line interface for http://multiplayerrobot.com/

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

I am still developing this so it may not easily work for you.

Development Notes and Ideas
---------------------------

**./gmr games**

Lists all games you're currently in, with player names.

**./gmr play**

Show a list of games where it's your turn, then when selecting one, it will download the save file to the default location in Linux.

It will wait for you to play your turn and detect a new save game in the hotseat save game directory, and ask for you to submit.
